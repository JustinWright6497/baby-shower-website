# PostgreSQL Migration Setup Guide

## Current Status âœ…
- âœ… PostgreSQL package installed (`pg` v8.11.3)
- âœ… Database schema defined in `pgData.js`
- âœ… All routes updated to use PostgreSQL
- âœ… Migration script ready
- âœ… Server configured to initialize PostgreSQL
- âœ… Updated guest list in `data.txt` ready for migration

## Data Status ðŸ“Š
- **Current data source**: `backend/data/data.txt` (updated guest list)
- **Old CSV files**: Outdated - contains old family/guest information
- **Migration needed**: Import current data from `data.txt` to PostgreSQL

## Steps to Complete Migration

### 1. Add PostgreSQL Addon to Railway
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click "New" â†’ "Database" â†’ "Add PostgreSQL"
3. Wait for the addon to be provisioned
4. Railway will automatically set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

### 2. Deploy to Railway
```bash
# Commit and push your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add PostgreSQL migration with updated data.txt"
git push
```

### 3. Run Migration (After Deployment)
Once deployed, you can run the migration in one of two ways:

**Option A: Via Railway CLI (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI if you haven't already
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Run migration with current data
railway run npm run update:data
```

**Option B: Via Railway Dashboard**
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click on your backend service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add a temporary variable: `RUN_MIGRATION=true`
5. The server will automatically run migration on startup

### 4. Verify Migration
After migration, check your application:
1. Visit your deployed frontend
2. Try logging in with a guest account
3. Check the admin panel to see if data is loaded
4. Test RSVP functionality

### 5. Clean Up (Optional)
Once everything is working:
1. Remove the `RUN_MIGRATION` variable if you used Option B
2. You can delete the old CSV files from your repository (keep backups!)
3. Update your `.gitignore` to exclude CSV files

## Environment Variables Needed

Railway should automatically set these when you add the PostgreSQL addon:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string (auto-set by Railway)

Optional but recommended:
- `SESSION_SECRET` - For session security (already configured)

## Data Migration Details

The migration will:
1. **Parse `data.txt`** - Read the current guest list with family structure
2. **Create PostgreSQL tables** - Set up families, guests, and RSVPs tables
3. **Import current data** - Add all families and guests from your updated list
4. **Skip removed entries** - Ignore families/guests marked with 'x' or '--'
5. **Preserve structure** - Maintain family relationships and member counts

## Key Changes from Old Data
- Updated family names (e.g., "Molly Hemphill" vs "Molly Lalumandier")
- Corrected guest names (e.g., "Sydnee Rust" vs "Sydney Rust")
- Removed families/guests marked for removal
- Added new families and guests

## Troubleshooting

### DATABASE_URL Not Set
- Make sure you've added the PostgreSQL addon to your Railway project
- Check that the addon is properly provisioned
- Redeploy your application after adding the addon

### Migration Fails
- Check Railway logs for detailed error messages
- Ensure your `data.txt` file is properly formatted
- Verify the PostgreSQL addon is running

### Connection Issues
- Check that `NODE_ENV=production` is set (for SSL)
- Verify the `DATABASE_URL` format is correct
- Ensure the PostgreSQL addon is in the same Railway project

## Data Backup

Before running migration:
1. Keep a backup of your current `data.txt` file
2. Keep a backup of your current working system
3. Test the migration locally first if possible

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:
1. Your `data.txt` file is still in the repository
2. You can temporarily switch back to CSV by updating the routes
3. The PostgreSQL addon can be removed from Railway if needed
